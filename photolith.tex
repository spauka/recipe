\subsubsection{Aim}
Weaken the non-exposed resist

\noindent \textbf{Need}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item chip
\item tweezers
\item clean mask (upper side: silver, bottom side: chrome)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item At the bottom left part, check that the device is in:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, noitemsep]
\item Constant power mode ($\neq$ constant intensity)
\item Watts mode ($\neq$ \si{\milli\watt\per\square\centi\meter})
\end{itemize}
\item Turn power on lamp on (bottom right switch)
\item Press and hold the start button (around 2 sec) until the sound `wiiiii' vanishes.
Device is powered up when levels on left/bottom gauges have moved from zero.
\item Wait 10 min for the lamp to warm up
\item Switch on the power to the aligner
\item At the bottom left, set up modes to:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, noitemsep]
  \item Constant Intensity
  \item \si{\milli\watt\per\square\centi\meter}
\end{itemize}
\item Check that the aligner is indicating pressure mode
\item Hit \boxed{exposure-test} switch to make place and check the exposure properties
\item Check the exposure time and intensity:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, noitemsep]
  \item Exposure time at 1.6 sec
  \item Check the wavelength is \SI{365}{\nano\meter}
  \item Hit \boxed{shutter} on/off to check the power which should be 10 mW (to be read on one of the bottom left gauges)
  \item Hit \boxed{pulse} to check and save the exposure time
  \item After the pulse, the lamp will move out of the way and the microscope into position
\end{itemize}
\item Hit the mask \boxed{load} button to move the microscope out of the way
\item Put the chip on the right stage
\item Hit \boxed{load} to load the chip at the place where the mask will be
\item Manually position the mask above the chip without touching the chip and without lying the mask on the vacuum line
\item Unload the chip (hitting \boxed{clear})
\item Put the mask on the vacuum line
\item Hit \boxed{vac} to clamp the mask with vacuum
\item Load the chip
\item Swing the microscope back (mask \boxed{load})
\item Wait for the light corresponding to "contact" to be green (chip can be moved) and not red (chip must not be moved).
(Note: if the light does not illuminate, swing the microscope out and back)
\item Turn the \boxed{lamp~saver} off
\item Adjust the chip position under the mask using joysticks (take care of the maximum displacement range of joysticks)
\item Press \boxed{contact} to make the mask in contact with the chip
\item Press \boxed{exposure}. The chip will automatically swing out
\item Unload the chip, put it back in its box
\item Press \boxed{load} to put the microscope on the right
\item Press \boxed{vac} to free the mask
\item Put the mask in its box, ensure it is firmly closed
\item Turn off powers on top, then bottom of the device
\item Switch modes to:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, noitemsep]
\item Constant Power
\item Watts
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Exposed resist is removed (negative resist)
\item If the 'separate' light does not illumiate, move the microscope back and forward (hit the mask \boxed{load} button twice).
\item To clean the mask, spray IPA on both sides, gently wipe with clean room wipes. Blow dry with nitrogen.
\item Turn the lamp on 5 mins before you need to align, it needs time to start up.
\end{itemize}
