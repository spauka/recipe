# USYD Fabrication Recipe
The following document describes the steps that we perform to fabricate quantum dot devices.

To a large degree it is specific to the equipment and processes that were developed at the ANFF-NSW cleanrooms,
however the general steps should apply anywhere. With fabrication, numbers vary from equipment to equipment so
one should not expect the steps to carry across without experimentation.
