\section{Annealing}
\subsubsection{Aim}
Anneal the ohmics

\subsubsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item On program window: 'LSP'=temperature settings, 'strange display'=time.
\item The annealing process takes place in a mixture of forming gas and nitrogen
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Recipe}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \SI{8}{\second} ramp to \SI{130}{\degreeCelsius} (step 0 to 1), wait at this temperature for \SI{60}{\second} (step 1 to 2)
\item \SI{15}{\second} ramp to \SI{430}{\degreeCelsius} (step 2 to 3), wait at this temperature for \SI{110}{\second} (step 3 to 4)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the N$_2$ bottle, check the pressure
\item Open the red bottle (forming gas)
\item Open water valve in/out
\item Plug the big orange power cable / turn on the power
\item Turn the annealer on (at its back)
\item Load your sample
\item Open the N$_2$ valve for 3 minutes
\item While this is going we can program the annealer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
  \item Select program 2 (USYD):
  \item Hit (hold?) \fbox{set} until the `program' light turns on.
  \item Choose the wanted pattern with the \fbox{pattern} button, adjust it
  \item For each step:
  \begin{itemize}[nolistsep,noitemsep]
    \item Switch between each pattern step with left and right arrows \fbox{<} or \fbox{>}
    \item Switch between temperature and time with up and down arrows
    \item Adjust the temperature or the time with the up and down arrows \fbox{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{$\ll$}} or \fbox{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{$\gg$}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Switch to annealing gas. Run for 3 minutes.
\item Hit \fbox{on}
\item Hold \fbox{run}
\item Allow the program to run. As soon as it completes, switch to gas selector to nitrogen.
\item Turn off valves for forming gas
\item Wait till the temperature reaches \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}
\item Set gas selector to closed.
\end{enumerate}
